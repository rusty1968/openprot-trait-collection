#### Overview

This section provides a summary of the traits defined for abstracting flash storage operations and their quality of abstractions. The traits are designed to offer a transparent and consistent interface for interacting with flash memory, ensuring safety and modularity.

#### Traits

1. **Region Trait**
    - **Purpose**: Defines a contiguous piece of memory between two addresses.
    - **Methods**:
        - `start(&self) -> u32`: Returns the start address of the region.
        - `end(&self) -> u32`: Returns the end address of the region.
        - `contains(&self, address: u32) -> bool`: Checks if a given address is contained within the region.

2. **ReadStorage Trait**
    - **Purpose**: Provides a transparent read-only interface for storage peripherals.
    - **Methods**:
        - `read(&mut self, offset: u32, bytes: &mut [u8]) -> Result<(), Self::Error>`: Reads data from the storage peripheral starting at the given address offset.
        - `capacity(&self) -> usize`: Returns the capacity of the storage peripheral in bytes.

3. **Storage Trait**
    - **Purpose**: Extends `ReadStorage` to provide a read/write interface for storage peripherals.
    - **Methods**:
        - `write(&mut self, offset: u32, bytes: &[u8]) -> Result<(), Self::Error>`: Writes data to the storage peripheral starting at the given address offset.

#### Quality of Abstractions

- **Safety**: The traits are designed with safety in mind, using Rust's type system to enforce safe operations and prevent undefined behavior. The `#![deny(unsafe_code)]` directive ensures that no unsafe code is used, promoting memory safety and reliability.
- **Modularity**: The traits are modular, allowing for easy extension and implementation for different types of storage devices. This modularity makes it simple to adapt the traits to various hardware platforms.
- **Transparency**: The traits provide a transparent interface for storage operations, abstracting away the underlying hardware details. This transparency simplifies the code and makes it easier to understand and maintain.
- **Error Handling**: The use of `Result` types for methods ensures robust error handling, allowing for clear and consistent management of errors that may occur during storage operations.
