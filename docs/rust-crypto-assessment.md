# RustCrypto Assessment

### Limitations of RustCrypto Traits for Hardware Accelerators

- Infallible Design: Hardware accelerators can produce various errors related to timing, resource contention, and hardware faults. The infallible design of RustCrypto traits does not capture these errors, making it difficult to handle them effectively.

- Detailed Error Information: Hardware accelerators may provide detailed error codes and diagnostic information that are not represented by the infallible traits. This lack of granularity can hinder effective error diagnosis and resolution.

Error Propagation: In hardware-accelerated environments, errors can propagate through multiple layers of abstraction, from the hardware itself to the driver and application layers. RustCrypto traits do not provide mechanisms to propagate these errors, leading to incomplete error handling.
